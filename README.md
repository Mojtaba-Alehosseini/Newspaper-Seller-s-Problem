# Newspaper Seller's Problem
+ A System Modeling and Simulation for Newspaper Seller's Problem using VBA in Office Excel.
+ A Python code is uploaded too.
+ The paper seller buys the papers for 33 cents (u can change it) each and sells them for 50 cents each (u can change it too).
+ Newspapers not sold at the end of the day are sold as scrap for 5 cents each (u can change it too).
+ Newspapers can be purchased in bundles of 10. Thus, the paper seller can buy 50, 60, and so on.
+ There are three types of news days, “good”, “fair”, and “poor”, with probabilities of 0.35, 0.45, and 0.20, respectively (u can change it).
+ The problem is to determine the optimal number of papers the newspaper seller should purchase.
+ This will be accomplished by simulating demands for 60 days and recording profits from sales each day.(u can change NO. of days simulating and repeated times)
+ You can change everythings :)
+ You can see all the details in Simulation Table and Repeat Table and Profit Table.
+ Profit= (revenue from sales) - (cost of newspapers) - (lost profit from excess demand) + (salvage from sale of scrap papers)
